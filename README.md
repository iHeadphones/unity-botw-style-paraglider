# "Breath of The Wild" style paraglider in Unity3D 

I made this little Unity (2018.2.7f1) project in 9/2018. It is an attempt to replicate the feel of the paraglider in Zelda: Breath of The Wild.

Someone in the Youtube comments requested the source code, so here it is. I'm only uploading the minimal amount for someone to hopefully understand how it works, so don't expect to be able to load it in Unity and press play. It's mostly just simple force vectors.
